Tier 01 TLift shaft builder
Tier 01 TLift
Tier 01 TLift Controller 
Tier 02 TLift shaft builder
Tier 02 TLift
Tier 02 TLift Controller
Guide Rails
Guide Rail Former

Block Behaviors:
Multi Blocks:
Tier 01 TLift Shaft builder: 
Can determine if you want it  square.
Will require blocks feed to it to build shaft such as (Rock,Rough Hewn Rock, Cold-Cavern Rock)
Will be able to detect if there is a machine in the way blocking the making of the shaft
Also able to detect other shafts builders or shafts from this mod and determine if they are overlapping (will not work if they are)
